Dev-panda is an app geared towards Software Developers in the Seattle area. It uses the API's from meetups and google maps to create one place where developers can go to find networking opportunities. Meetups can be difficult to navigate and give you mixed results when looking for a specific type of meetup. this app narrows it down to tech related meetups only. it is currently only available for use in Seattle. We are working on a solution that will reach more users. 

Please enjoy our app! I hope you will find fun new opportunities here!
